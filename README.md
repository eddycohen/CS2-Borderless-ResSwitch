# CS2-Borderless-ResSwitch

🎮 **CS2-Borderless-ResSwitch** is a simple `.bat` tool that launches Counter-Strike 2 in fullscreen **borderless** mode with a matching Windows resolution, and restores your native resolution when the game is closed.

🛠️ Perfect for avoiding black bars, stretched aspect ratios, and alt+tab issues — especially for 4:3 or 16:10 CS2 players.

## 💡 How it works

1. You choose the **in-game resolution** you want for CS2.
2. The script sets your Windows desktop to that resolution.
3. CS2 launches automatically (via Steam).
4. Once you quit the game, your **native resolution** is restored.

## 📦 Files included

- `CS2-Borderless-ResSwitch.bat` → the main launcher script
- `QRes.exe` → lightweight utility to change Windows resolution

> Make sure both files are in the same folder when you run the script.
